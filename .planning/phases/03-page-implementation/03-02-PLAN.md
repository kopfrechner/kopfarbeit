<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Finalize 'Freshly Squeezed' Hero</name>
  <files>src/pages/index.astro</files>
  <action>
    - Update Hero copy to be more energetic and specific to the "Soda Zitrone" theme.
      - Example H1: "Soda Zitrone: Freshly Squeezed Code & Design"
      - Example Subtext: "Refreshing perspectives on software engineering, AI, and digital craftsmanship."
    - Style the H1:
      - Use `font-heading` (Archivo Black).
      - Ensure it is large (e.g., `text-5xl` to `text-7xl`).
      - Apply `uppercase` and `tracking-tighter`.
      - Maybe add a slight rotation or a "sticker" background effect to parts of the text.
    - Polish Asset Placement:
      - Optimize `Bottle` and `Leaf` positions.
      - Maybe add more instances or adjust sizes for better "splash" effect.
      - Ensure they don't obscure text on mobile.
    - Ensure the main container has `border-neo` and `shadow-neo` with no rounding.

    3. Check the "Soda Zitrone" typewriter effect and tactile hover.
    4. Evaluate the Hero section: Does it feel "Freshly Squeezed"? Is the typography bold enough? Do the assets (Lemon, Bottle, Leaf) feel integrated?
