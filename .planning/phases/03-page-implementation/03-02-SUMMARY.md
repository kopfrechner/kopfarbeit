# Summary: Freshly Squeezed Hero (03-02)

## Objective
Finalize the homepage Hero section to deliver a "Freshly Squeezed" high-impact brand experience.

## Changes
- **src/pages/index.astro**:
    - Updated H1 to "Soda Zitrone: Freshly Squeezed Code & Design" with increased size (`text-7xl`) and tighter leading.
    - Updated subtext to be more energetic and specific to the brand theme.
    - Replaced text-links in hero with prominent neobrutalist buttons (`READ BLOG` in Zest, `ABOUT ME` in White).
    - Enlarged and optimized the placement of pixel-art assets (`Bottle` and `Leaf`) for a more dynamic "splash" effect.
    - Added subtle hover scaling to hero assets for extra tactile feedback.
    - Increased hero container padding for better balance with the larger typography.

## Verification Results
- Hero section is visually striking and brand-aligned.
- Typography uses `font-heading` (Archivo Black) and is extremely bold.
- Assets enhance the "Freshly Squeezed" vibe without obscuring content.
- Mobile responsiveness maintained through opacity and sizing adjustments.

## Next Steps
- Final polish (Phase 4): Ensure search and comments components match the new aesthetic.
