# KopfarbeIT 🧠

**KopfarbeIT** is the personal blog and digital playground of **Christoph Kopf**. It's a space where I document my thoughts, technical discoveries, and the projects I build. Based in Linz, Austria, I've spent years in the .NET ecosystem and am currently exploring Kotlin, Spring, and the transformative impact of AI on software engineering.

## 🎯 About the Project

This blog is built using a customized version of the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme. It serves as both a public portfolio and a personal knowledge base.

### Key Focus Areas:
- **.NET Ecosystem**: Deep dives into C# and modern software engineering patterns.
- **Modern Web**: Venturing into Kotlin, Spring, and Astro.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Documenting "vibe coding" sessions and AI integration.
- **Developer Tools**: Building and sharing tools like the Scalar OpenAPI Viewer.

## 💻 Tech Stack
