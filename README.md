# Sodazitron 🍋

**Sodazitron** is the personal blog and digital playground of **Christoph Kopf**. It's a space where I document my thoughts, technical discoveries, and the projects I build. Based in Linz, Austria, I've spent years in the .NET ecosystem and am currently exploring Kotlin, Spring, and the transformative impact of AI on software engineering.

## 🎯 About the Project

This blog is built using a customized version of the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme. It serves as both a public portfolio and a personal knowledge base.

### Key Focus Areas:

- **.NET Ecosystem**: Deep dives into C# and modern software engineering patterns.
- **Modern Web**: Venturing into Kotlin, Spring, and Astro.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Documenting "vibe coding" sessions and AI integration.
- **Developer Tools**: Building and sharing tools like the Scalar OpenAPI Viewer.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Astro v5](https://astro.build/) (Static Site Generation)
- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Search**: [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) (Static search indexing)
- **Content**: Type-safe Markdown using Astro Content Collections
- **Deployment**: [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
- **Comments**: [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) (GitHub Discussions powered)

## 🚀 Recent Achievements

- **Performance**: Maintaining a near-perfect Lighthouse score for accessibility, SEO, and performance.
- **Automation**: Integrated CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and Pagefind indexing.
