Welcome to my digital logbook. This is where I document my thoughts, discoveries, and the things I build.

Primarily, this blog serves as a personal log of my learning journey. I share it here in the hope that it might be useful or interesting to others.

## Background

I live in **Linz**, Austria, and studied **Software Engineering** at **FH Hagenberg** (Bachelor and Master), graduating in 2012. My career started in research, working on **3D image processing** and real-time reconstruction, until I discovered web engineering. **.NET** remains my primary focus and long-time companion, though I've recently ventured into **Kotlin** and **Spring**. Currently, my curiosity drives me to explore how **AI** is shaping the future of software engineering.

Thanks for stopping by.
