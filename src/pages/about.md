I call this blog **_sodazitron.dev_** because it's such a tasty, refreshing and energizing drink 🍋 It vanishes the fog from the mind and helps to think clearly. Hope the blog is as refreshing, thanks for stopping by.

I personally live in **Linz**, Austria, studied **Software Engineering** at **FH Hagenberg** and graduated in 2012. I started out in research, working on **3D image processing** and real-time reconstruction, before moving into web engineering.

**.NET** is my primary focus, though I've been working with **Kotlin** and **Spring** lately. Currently, I'm exploring how **AI** is changing software development.

Stay refreshed.
